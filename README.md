The purpose here is to fetch tweets that mention @bicyclerack. These tweets (hopefully)
will include a photo and geolocation data of a bicycle rack/stand, i.e. a place
to park and lockup your bicycle. The tweets shall be copied into the mongodb
where we store such data.

I registered bikestandmap.com and bikerackmap.com and wasn't sure which was more 
preferable. So, here are some google scores:

- "bike stand" about 1,140,000 results
- "bike rack" about 6,730,000 results
- "bicycle rack" about 991,000 results
- "bicycle stand" about 291,000 results

So I'm going with bikerackmap.com as the standard domain.
